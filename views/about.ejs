			<h1 class="text-center">Hello, I'm Katya</h1>
			<p class="main-text"> I was born in a small town in Russia in 1987, where I lived for 19 years until eventually moving to the United States in 2008. Although I love Russia and visit my family there as often as I can, I never regretted the decision to come to the States and I feel truly at home here.

			For a few years I worked in a small resort boutique in Rehoboth, DE and boy was that a great time living and working at the beach! But after a while it became clear to me that the job was not fulfilling and my creative itch was not being scratched. In the fall of 2013 I enrolled in a local community college and 1.5 years later graduated with an Associate Degree in Web Development. College was great, it combined everything I was desperate for in my daily life - learning, creating, and the feeling of accomplishment.

			After walking the stage and receiving my diploma, my learning journey did not end though, it has just began. I took any opportunity I could to soak up the knowledge from any available sources. I read books, listened to the development podcasts, signed up for online courses, followed tutorials, and simultaneously worked on personal projects. I dug into the web development universe of knowledge and it seemed like the more I learned, the less I knew. It would be exhaustive if it wasn't for one simple fact - I thoroughly enjoyed the process! And I still do.
